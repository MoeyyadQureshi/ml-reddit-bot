# Lesson 7: Debugging and Intro to NLP

[IMPORTANT slideshow with all the concepts we covered](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JtyxCZgrOoT88ObknnBJi-gtsclQWGEpIebIQSacIjg/edit?usp=sharing)

This will be the final Coffee N Code lesson for this term. Today I'll be going around helping everyone debug the cyberbullying detection engine they built so they can run it on their computer. It could be a cool project to have on your resume or talk about during an interview so I definitely to get it working for everybody. 

Following the debugging, I'll go over the final code one more time and help clear up any concepts! We will be going through [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JtyxCZgrOoT88ObknnBJi-gtsclQWGEpIebIQSacIjg/edit?usp=sharing) to help visualize and understand the concepts we used. I realize last week's lesson was very rushed, so I want to make sure people understand all aspects of our cyberbullying detection engine. I will also be taking any questions for a Q&A so please ask if you are unsure of anything. Questions can be submitted to the machine-learning-bot channel on slack or just raise your hand.

## Debugging

While I help debug code for those of you who don't have it working, I want the people with working code to form group of 2-4 and collaboratively go over your code line by line, making sure each of you can explain precisely what each block of code does. If there is any code you don't understand, write it down and I'll go over it during the Q&A.

## Code Review and Q&A

First I'll be going over all the code we written, focusing on any lines of code people aren't clear about. This will be accompanied by a slideshow throughly explaining everything we used. Following this, we'll do a brief Q&A for those of you who still have questions!


## Continuing Your ML Journey

Thank you for being here and attending these lessons! I'm very happy so many of you show up weekly to learn about ML. For those of you want to continue learning about ML and maybe eventually work as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer, I've compiled the following resources.

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). This is a great book that will take you from 0 to competitent enough to pass a technical interview with Python through a variety of lessons and exercises. Unfortunately this resource is not free. While Python is not the only language that can do machine learning, it is the main one.

- [Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) online course. Personally, this was how I got my start in machine learning. After learning Python, I'd strongly recommend taking this course.

- Kaggle data science competitions such as [Quora's Insincere Question Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion) challenge would be a very good place to practice and develop your skills after becoming familiar with Python and machine learning fundementals. If this doesn't interest you, working on your own machine learning side project serves the same purpose.
