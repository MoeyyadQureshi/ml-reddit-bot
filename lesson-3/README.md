# Lesson 3: End to End Machine Learning
By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to go from 0 to 100 in solving a machine learning problem. From the first step to the last.

## Today's Schedule

- Going through the slideshow which is found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zyiUfL70mWu7iQzaAqUGCTFadsqfEsgeRFfIq9C_dMQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## No Coding Today

This lesson and the next will focus on purely the machine learning side of things. We will return to software development during lessons 5 and 6 when we build the cyberbullying detection bot.
